# Sources-of-60-water
Im sorry but Sources from google isn't enough. Whist true it is from the matter of learned from or where, but do also note the context of of it. (ie. why even put in change in schools? if a learning institution doesnt matter in the first place. a weirdly incorrect juxtaposition.)

anyway, do also note that I did state the context of "the average human adult body" not parts of the body. By separating each into sections and not adding up to the average of the whole, isn't by sense, the same. ie. it's like dividing each river and ocean to an average, it isn't the mean of the total water on earth is it not? Humans are approximately 75% water by mass as infants and 50% to 60% water by mass as adults. [Martinoli, R. Acta Diabetologica, vol. 40, no. 0][Lote, Christopher J. Principles of Renal Physiology, 5th edition. Springer. p. 2.][Brinkman, Joshua E., et al. “Physiology, Body Fluids.” Nih.gov]. Nowhere in my comment states from a body part, or anything within human biology. I only state the mean average of the human adult body. There can be variation, (thats why its called an "average"), i have no doubt in that but reliably using data from government funded and co-sponsored institutions (ie, what i used in this comment: the National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. Geological Studies and the British Nutritional foundation.) is at best verified and accepted
